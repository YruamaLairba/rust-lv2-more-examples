# Programming LV2 Plugins - Rust Edition

This repository contains examples showing how to use the rust-lv2 framework. One idea is to have examples focused on one aspect/extension of the LV2 Spec. Another idea of this project is to have some examples to test usability of the rust-lv2.

## Building the samples
This project use a virtual workspace to share building artefact and speedup recompilation. Use `cargo build` to build all project or Use `cargo build -p <package>` to build a specific example.

## Licensing
